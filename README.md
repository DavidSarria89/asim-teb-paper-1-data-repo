It contains several folder with the data files and figures :

- `simulations` : datafiles and figures obtained from simulations
- `measurement` : datafiles and figures of the data recorded by ASIM-MXGS for the TEB TGF event 180916, post-processed (i.e. in physical units)
- `WWLLN` : subset of the WWLLN data around the ASIM-MXGS TGF TEB event 180916
- `TEB_explanation_sketch` : `.svg` inkscape project for figure 1

See the `README.txt` files inside the different folders and sub-folders for more info.


Note: Data tables can also be extracted from `.fig` files using MATLAB, e.g. using the `findobj` function.
